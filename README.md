This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function.  The bug arises from two common scenarios: inconsistent units within the calculation and inconsistent spacing around the operators. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue is that the calculation may fail, producing unexpected results or rendering errors.   This is particularly tricky because the errors aren't always consistent across browsers.
